To get setup, clone this repository and `npm install`.

Run a server locally using `node server.js`.

Now, you'll need a client connection using [socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/client-api/).

For example:

```javascript
const socket = io("http://localhost:8080")
socket.on("templateList", console.log)
socket.on("deviceConnected", updateData)
```

You can write your own templates and export them in `templates/index.js`. I've included one sample template called `deviceConnected`. It can be used like so:

```javascript
const options = {
  template: "deviceConnected",
  frequency: {
    leaseMinutes: 2,
    mean: 1,
    dev: 0.3
  }
}
socket.emit("template", options)
```

The server will broadcast to your connection for the data generated by the `deviceConnected` template for two minutes, with a normally distributed frequency with mean 1 (second) and stddev of 0.3 (seconds).

I've included chance.js because I like it, faker.js is also an option, or this could be extended to support custom templates via an http server and a POST request or similar socket communication.
